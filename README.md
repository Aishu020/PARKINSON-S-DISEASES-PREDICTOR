Parkinson's Disease Predictor

Problem :

Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.

Solution:

This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has chances of cardiac arrest or is prone to get it in future by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

Idea:

Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
